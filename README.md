# Well, hello

I'm not a developer or anything so I didn't bother to "optimize" a few things AI to make it look better. (Of course not everything hey..)
But so what? As long as it works it's good.

Im not here that active so updates to plugins may take a while. But the latest versions of plugin/s are stable and 100% working on version 1.20.2. Other 
versions are not tested but it should work on 1.20.3, 1.20.4, 1.20.5, 1.20.6. And maybe a 1.18.x and 1.19.x. You can try it. But *use it at your own risk*. But I really dont know
if its "risk", but i must put it there. Thanks :)
